# A-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Optimization-of-Hospital-Bed-Utilization

This project objetive is to build a ML model that allows a hospital to understand its bed availability by predicting when patient's will be discharged based on their clinic history as well as environmental factors and historic trends. This  information is crucial for a hospital's management in order to to inmprove bed capacity management efficiencies.
