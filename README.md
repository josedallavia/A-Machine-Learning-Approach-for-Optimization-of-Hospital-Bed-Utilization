# A-Machine-Learning-Approach-for-Optimization-of-Hospital-Bed-Availability

This project objetive is to build a ML model that allows a hospital to understand its bed availability at a certain point in time, by predicting when currently hospitalized patient's will be discharged based on their clinic history as well as environmental factors and historic trends. This  information is crucial for a hospital's management team in order to improve their bed capacity management efficiencies.
